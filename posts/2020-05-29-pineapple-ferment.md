title: Fermented Pineapple Fun
---

I learnt how to brew tepache at the UIUC fermentation club earlier this year,
and decided finally try it by it myself with the pineapple that I kept for too
long in my closet. [Tepache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepache) is a Mexican
fermented beverage made from pineapple flesh and rinds that is often spiced with
cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and some times even hot peppers like habaneros.

The fermentation is a sight to see as the natural yeasts from the pineapple are
capable of making a large mess with the large amounts of carbon dioxide they
produce. The gas carbonates the drink, and when opened by an unsuspecting brewer
can open like a champagne bottle.

Unlike my kombucha runs, this tepache run kept a nice head, which is suspect is
due to the abundance of pectins found within the pieces of fruit. When drinking
it I could feel the viscosity of the beverage on my tongue. I think itâ€™s not the
sugar because a previous failed batch that had gone too dry had a similar,
though ligher feel.

Like kombucha, a large amount of yeast detritus formed at the bottom of the brew
containers. I wonder if I can turn it into pineapple Marmite ðŸ˜„.

## Recipe & Methodology

I didnâ€™t want to buy all the spices and complications, do I decided to brew a
plain and pure, wild fermented pineapple drink. I used what I had available:

- Pineapple
- Ginger
- Sugar

I managed to let the pineapple sit out for a week both times I tried
making it, which was plenty of time for the exterior of the pineapple
to start getting funky in some places. I followed the following
procedure:

1. Carve pineapple skin on, discarding parts that were turning _funky_ on the
   outside. I cut the pieces small enough to fit through the opening of the
   bottle I was fermenting in.
2. Add a cup or so of sugar.
3. Add ginger in my case, but any spices such as clove or cinnamon.
4. Add water to fill container.
5. Cover with linen and let ferment!

The normal fermentation time of a couple days left the drink too sweet for my
liking, so I let it go for longer. Within five days it had gone super dry to my
surprise, thus for the second ferment I added some additional sugar to allow for
carbonation.

My attempts at tepache were a mixed bag this time around, and found that I liked
it mixed with kombucha in a half-half mix better. I may try again later to see
if I can make a version that I can enjoy by itself.
