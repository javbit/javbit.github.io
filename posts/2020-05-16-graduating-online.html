        <p>This Sunday, despite the pandemic and state-wide lock down, we celebrated. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign commemorated this yearly event in a unique way: online via live stream. Naturally, this is not what I nor hundreds of other graduates wanted, but it is how we worked around the constraints of the times.</p>
<p>One of the biggest travesties of moving online is the inability to meet with friends who would normally be on campus. Now we are thousands of kilometers apart, but share our connection through ether and wire.</p>
<p>Despite the trying situation, I hope to make the best of it: to relish the isolation and peace; to take a moment to reflect on who I am and where I want to go. Naturally this is a process that should happen over time but now is as good a time as ever to start living deliberately.</p>
<p>Personally, I am learning how hard it is to find employment, not only because of a sunk job market but also my own anxiety of applying. I am not sure how to deal with this other than saddle-up<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and slide bum-first to where I ought to go.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I am excited to join the UIUC alumni family and step into a new stage of my life. Not sure where to go yet, but hopefully it’s cool and is close the the ocean.</p>
