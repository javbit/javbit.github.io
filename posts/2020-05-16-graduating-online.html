        <p>A month or two of quarantine has already gone by. It’s quite surreal to think that in all the time I have spent doing nothing but not following by standard routine of attending classes and hanging out with friends I have managed to graduate. The stimulus and the result do not match in my head.</p>
<p>I’m sitting here watching the names float on up past my window to the virtual commencement ceremony. A massive parade of names celebrates our collective achievements, but it does not feel right. The effort was put in, but the result failed to match up to the ascent leading up to this moment.</p>
<p>This may have not been how I imagined I would end the semester, but nonetheless I am excited to join the Illinois family of alumni. I cannot see where I’m headed right now, but hopefully it ends with a salty breeze by the ocean.</p>
