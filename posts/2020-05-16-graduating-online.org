title: On Graduating Online
---

A month or two of quarantine has already gone by.  It's quite surreal
to think that in all the time I have spent doing nothing but not
following by standard routine of attending classes and hanging out
with friends I have managed to graduate.  The stimulus and the result
do not match in my head.

I'm sitting here watching the names float on up past my window to the
virtual commencement ceremony.  A massive parade of names celebrates
our collective achievements, but it does not feel right.  The effort
was put in, but the result failed to match up to the ascent leading up
to this moment.

This may have not been how I imagined I would end the semester, but
nonetheless I am excited to join the Illinois family of alumni.  I
cannot see where I'm headed right now, but hopefully it ends with a
salty breeze by the ocean.
