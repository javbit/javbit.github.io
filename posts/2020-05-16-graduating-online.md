title: On Graduating Online
---

A month or two of quarantine has already gone by. It’s surreal to think that in
all the time that I’ve spent in a standard routine of attending my classes,
completing my schoolwork, and hanging out with friends whenever possible, that
I’ve managed to graduate. It feels like the result came a lot sooner than I
thought it would.

As I’m sitting here in my room watching the names float up on by my window as
part of the virtual commencement ceremony, all the buildup formed from my
experiences from school come to a rather quiet end. It feels sad that a lot of
fun experiences I had are going to come to an end, but freedom of my own time
and what I can do with it is exciting. I wonder what I’m going to do with my
summer.
