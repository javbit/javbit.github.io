        <p>I learnt how to make tepache from the UIUC fermentation club earlier in the year. Tepache is a Mexican fermented and spiced pineapple drink, often consisting of cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and even hot chilies like habaneros.</p>
<p>It’s quite a sight to see ferment, as the natural yeast on the pineapple create quite the mess with large amounts of carbon dioxide that causes foam overs. I suspect the head causing component is the copious amount of pectin and other fruit connectives. It also creates quite a bit of yeast detritus which is always quite amusing to see floating around or gumming up at the bottom. I wonder if it can be turned into pineapple Marmite 😂.</p>
<p>I decided to make a pure, wild fermented pineapple drink when I decided against buying all the spices and required parts as I only had ginger and sugar for fermentation at the time.</p>
<p>I managed to let the pineapple sit out for a week both times I tried making it, which was plenty of time for the exterior of the pineapple to start getting funky in some places. I followed the following procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carve pineapple skin on, discarding parts that were turning <em>funky</em> on the outside. The pieces were cut small enough to fit through a fairly large bottle opening.</li>
<li>Add a cup or so of sugar.</li>
<li>Add ginger in my case, but any spices such as clove or cinnamon.</li>
<li>Add water to fill container.</li>
<li>Cover with linen and let ferment!</li>
</ol>
<p>The normal fermentation time of a few days left the drink too sweet for my liking, so I let it go for longer. Within five days it had gone quite dry to my surprise, thus for the second ferment I added some additional sugar to allow for carbonation.</p>
<p>In the end, I am not a huge fan of it other that its thick texture. I do find mixing it with an equal part of kombucha for the second ferment produces a fantastic drink that masks some of the astringency found in my brews.</p>
