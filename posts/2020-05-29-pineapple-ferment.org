title: Fermented Pineapple Fun
---

I learnt how to make tepache from the UIUC fermentation club earlier
in the year.  Tepache is a Mexican fermented and spiced pineapple
drink, often consisting of cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and even hot
chilies like habaneros.

It's quite a sight to see ferment, as the natural yeast on the
pineapple create quite the mess with large amounts of carbon dioxide
that causes foam overs.  I suspect the head causing component is the
copious amount of pectin and other fruit connectives.  It also creates
quite a bit of yeast detritus which is always quite amusing to see
floating around or gumming up at the bottom.  I wonder if it can be
turned into pineapple Marmite ðŸ˜‚.

I decided to make a pure, wild fermented pineapple drink when I
decided against buying all the spices and required parts as I only had
ginger and sugar for fermentation at the time.

I managed to let the pineapple sit out for a week both times I tried
making it, which was plenty of time for the exterior of the pineapple
to start getting funky in some places.  I followed the following
procedure:

1. Carve pineapple skin on, discarding parts that were turning /funky/
   on the outside.  The pieces were cut small enough to fit through a
   fairly large bottle opening.
2. Add a cup or so of sugar.
3. Add ginger in my case, but any spices such as clove or cinnamon.
4. Add water to fill container.
5. Cover with linen and let ferment!

The normal fermentation time of a few days left the drink too sweet
for my liking, so I let it go for longer. Within five days it had gone
quite dry to my surprise, thus for the second ferment I added some
additional sugar to allow for carbonation.

In the end, I am not a huge fan of it other that its thick texture.  I
do find mixing it with an equal part of kombucha for the second
ferment produces a fantastic drink that masks some of the astringency
found in my brews.
